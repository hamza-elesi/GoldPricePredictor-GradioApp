        Parameters:
            value: Default text for the button to display. If callable, the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.
            every: If `value` is a callable, run the function 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Has no effect otherwise. The event can be accessed (e.g. to cancel it) via this component's .load_event attribute.
            variant: 'primary' for main call-to-action, 'secondary' for a more subdued style, 'stop' for a stop button.
            size: Size of the button. Can be "sm" or "lg".
            icon: URL or path to the icon file to display within the button. If None, no icon will be displayed.
            link: URL to open when the button is clicked. If None, no link will be used.
            visible: If False, component will be hidden.
            interactive: If False, the Button will be in a disabled state.
            elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            elem_classes: An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            render: If False, component will not render be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.
            scale: relative size compared to adjacent Components. For example if Components A and B are in a Row, and A has scale=2, and B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer. scale applies in Rows, and to top-level Components in Blocks where fill_height=True.
            min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.
